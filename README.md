# Sloth Wall Event Planner
Project is hosted at https://dry-hollows-13147.herokuapp.com

This event planner is a web application designed to allow users to create and download .ics files according to many of the icalendar specifications listed at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7986. This is a class project for UH Manoa as part of ICS 414.

The app was built using React, Express, MongoDB and Node.js. Just as a web app you can run the client, fill out the form and download the ics file. If you want additional database and backend functionality you can run both.
